# Loud-Silence-by Anne Noir 
Artist's Statement:
An audio piece along with a supporting visual, "Loud Silence" tells the tale of the feeling of unease across generations. Using audio samples of events I gathered by asking my family members what has impacted them in their lives; I have created a compilation of the different stories, be it traumatic or good that has left an impact of my family forever.
